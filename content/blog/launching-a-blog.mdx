Recently I experienced something one might describe as a kind of epiphany,
although I'm quite embarassed to not think that way about it earlier.

I had been playing around with different programming languages, building small just-for-fun projects for about 20 years
and professionally developing software for just over a decade
when I figured that I might have collected one or two pieces of knowledge along the way
that might be worth sharing and was searching for ways to do so.  
As a first step I decided to intensify my contributions to open source.

Along that way I stumbled over the [Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/) repositories.
[Kent](https://kentcdodds.com/) has done a phenomenal job there,
bringing people from different backgrounds together and creating a welcoming environment for new contributors.
He does the same [at his Discord](https://kcd.im/discord).
So I went with it and answered some questions that came up in the chat over the last couple of weeks.

Then it hit me:

When working on codebases I've been an advocate of
[DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) for a very long time.  
And yet I just typed a (nearly) identical response into the Discord chat for the third(?) time.

So I made a promise to myself:  
When I write a response longer than 2-3 lines,
I'll try to preserve the core of it as a blog post so that I later might just refer to it.

That's where we're at now.
The infrastructure is set and the next post hopefully will be about some interesting coding problem.
